# What is Azure Static Web Apps?
From your source code to worldwide availability, Azure Static Web Apps addresses the difficult difficulties. While you concentrate on designing your project, Azure Static Web Apps creates and hosts it using GitHub or Azure DevOps.

Libraries and frameworks such as Angular, React, Svelte, and Vue are often used to create static web apps. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and picture assets are used to construct these apps. When employing a standard web server design, these files, together with any relevant API endpoints, are provided from a single server.

Static assets are isolated from a standard web server and instead served from points globally spread around the world with Azure Static Web Apps. Because files are physically closer to users, this distribution makes serving files significantly faster. Optional API endpoints are hosted utilizing a serverless architecture, which eliminates the requirement for a full back-end server entirely.

The Azure Static Web Apps approach is that you get exactly what you need, nothing more, nothing less.

## Create the Azure Static App
You're a web developer who has developed a web app. A web app is often composed of HTML, JavaScript, or CSS files and can be developed manually or by using a framework.

Before you can deploy the app to Azure, you need to build it.

- Create a repository for your app on GitHub.
- Run the app locally and view it via a browser.

With the copy created locally, you’re all set to start working on your code and site. Now you’ll explore how to deploy your site to the cloud. You’ll use Azure Static Web Apps to host your site. Using Azure Static Web Apps will allow you to quickly post your web site to the world. You can explore more [Azure Tips and Tricks: Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/azure-tips-and-tricks-static-web-apps/) to learn more. 

Next, open Visual Studio Code then Open Folder in the editor.

1) If Azure Static Webs exptension isn't installed then install it first. Inside Visual Studio Code, select the Azure logo in the Activity Bar to open the Azure extensions window.

**Note: You are required to sign in to Azure and GitHub in Visual Studio Code to continue. If you are not already authenticated, the extension will prompt you to sign in to both services during the creation process.**

2) Under theStatic Web Apps label, select the plus sign.
