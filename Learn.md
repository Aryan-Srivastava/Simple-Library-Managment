# Learning Through Project

A simple library management project that is easy to use and easy to understand. I created this website while learning web development. I used all the basic concepts of JS in this project and my project will  help learners to understand the basic concepts of JS. I made this project using HTML, Bootstrap and JS. I also hosted this website using the Azure Static Web Apps service.
