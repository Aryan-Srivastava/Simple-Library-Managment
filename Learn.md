# Learning Through Project

A simple library management project that is easy to use and to understand. I created this website while learning web development. I used all the basic concepts of JS in this project, and my project will help learners to understand the basic concepts of JS. I developed this project using HTML, Bootstrap, and JS. Records of books are maintained and saved through **Local Storage**. I hosted this website using the Azure Static Web Apps service.
